- complete binary tree: 1. all levels are full except the last, 2. all nodes are at the left in the last level
- full binary tree: each node has 0 or 2 children
- perfect binary tree: all nodes have 2 children except the leaves
- balanced binary tree: the height difference between left and right substree of each node is at most 1
- Degenerated / Pathological binary tree, all parents have only one child, 退化，病理
- Red black tree
- AVL Tree
- B tree: self balanced, all internal and leaf nodes have data pointers
- B+ tree: only leaf nodes have data pointers
- B+ tree for DB: 1. more keys and pointers for index, less IO, 2. all query paths have the same length, 3. less scan for all data/leaf nodes
